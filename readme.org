A localisation of Emacs calendar to Croatian language.

To use, please place calendar-hr.el somewhere in your Emacs load-path, and
require calendar-hr somewhere in yoru init file.

I use this only occasionally myself, so there might be some bugs regarding names
and dates, if you find any please let me know.
